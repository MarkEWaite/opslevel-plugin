<div>
  A template string that we will use for each job to create the Service Alias.
</div>

<div>
  This field can be overridden at the job level by setting the 'Service Alias'.
  If neither of these fields are set we will default to ${JOB_NAME}.
  This will substitute in Environment variables present during the job.
</div>

<div>
  For example, if your build process injects a
  variable called SERVICE_NAME, you could set this field to:
  <code>
    ${SERVICE_NAME}
  </code>
</div>
